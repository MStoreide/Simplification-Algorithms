To Do
- Write script for Blender Edge Collapse algorithm with bpy.
- Finish ImagePlot.py script
- Rewrite simplification code as loops instead of brute forcing it for each object. 

Data Management
- Find solution for managing and accessing all data (Colorlab server?)

Hausdorff
- Edit csv output to be dictionary of values, and not filter.
- Rewrite as a function.

Statistics
- Import Hausdorff csvs from Hausdorff script.
- Create dataframes of data currently in Excell, either re-do or.
- Map rate of change between simplification stages.
- Map rate of change between simplification algorithms.
- Document xyz difference on different segments of the surface.
- Create output format(Hausdorff, other values).

Open3D
- Inspect ply files.

Done

- Create virtual environments for each script. Py 3.10 for Open3D, 3.7 for PyMeshLab ✔
- Get triangle counts for RM, SM, and UM Decimation. ✔
- Run RM, SM, and UM versions of Open3D Decimation. ✔
- Write Vertex Clustering script for Open3D. ✔
- Implement Pandas for statistics right here instead of excel. ✔
- Implement PyMeshLab feature for Hausdorff distance. ✔
